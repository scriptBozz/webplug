              engine results pages (SERPs), making it more visible to potential
              customers. Understanding SEO is essential for businesses looking
              to enhance their online visibility and reach their target audience
              effectively.What is SEO? SEO is the process of optimizing your
              website's content, structure, and performance to improve its
              visibility on search engines like Google, Bing, and Yahoo. When
              users search for specific keywords or phrases related to your
